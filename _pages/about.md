As a computational mechanics scientist, I specialize in developing and applying advanced numerical methods to tackle complex challenges in biomechanics, additive manufacturing, and multiphysics.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Delaware with the Multi-Scale Fiber-Reinforced Tissue Biomechanics Laboratory under Prof Dawn Elliott . 

I completed my doctoral studies from the University of Wisconsin-Madison at the Computational Mechanics and Multiphysics Group (CMMG) under Prof Shiva Rudraraju in May 2024. The title of my thesis was "Multiphysics Modeling of Deformation in Biomembranes and the Neuronal Microenvironment, With Application to Traumatic Brain Injury".
